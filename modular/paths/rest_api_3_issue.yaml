  summary: Create issue
  description: >-
    Creates an issue or, where the option to create subtasks is enabled in Jira,
    a subtask. A transition may be applied, to move the issue or subtask to a
    workflow step other than the default start step, and issue properties set.


    The content of the issue or subtask is defined using `update` and `fields`.
    The fields that can be set in the issue or subtask are determined using the
    [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get). These
    are the same fields that appear on the issue's create screen. Note that the
    `description`, `environment`, and any `textarea` type custom fields
    (multi-line text fields) take Atlassian Document Format content. Single line
    custom fields (`textfield`) accept a string and don't handle Atlassian
    Document Format content.


    Creating a subtask differs from creating an issue as follows:

     *  `issueType` must be set to a subtask issue type (use [ Get create issue metadata](#api-rest-api-3-issue-createmeta-get) to find subtask issue types).
     *  `parent` must contain the ID or key of the parent issue.

    In a next-gen project any issue may be made a child providing that the
    parent and child are members of the same project.


    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* and *Create
    issues* [project permissions](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for
    the project in which the issue or subtask is created.

        Whether the project in which the issue is created is added to the user's
        **Recently viewed** project list, as shown under **Projects** in Jira.
        When provided, the issue type and request type are added to the user's
        history for a project. These values are then used to provide defaults on
        the issue create screen.
