  summary: Get project issue type hierarchy
  description: >-
    Get the issue type hierarchy for a next-gen project.


    The issue type hierarchy for a project consists of:

     *  *Epic* at level 1 (optional).
     *  One or more issue types at level 0 such as *Story*, *Task*, or *Bug*. Where the issue type *Epic* is defined, these issue types are used to break down the content of an epic.
     *  *Subtask* at level -1 (optional). This issue type enables level 0 issue types to be broken down into components. Issues based on a level -1 issue type must have a parent issue.

    **[Permissions](#permissions) required:** *Browse projects* [project
    permission](https://confluence.atlassian.com/x/yodKLg) for the project.
